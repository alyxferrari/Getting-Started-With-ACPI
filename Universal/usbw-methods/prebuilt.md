# Fixing USB Wake: Prebuilt

By far the easiest way to get SSDT-USBW is just downloading the below file:

* [SSDT-USBW.aml](https://github.com/dortania/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/blob/master/extra-files/compiled/SSDT-USBW.aml)

This prebuilt file is just a precompiled version of [SSDT-USBW](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osy/USBWakeFixup/master/SSDT-USBW.dsl).

The main thing to note with this method:

* Doesn't really teach you anything
  * For most, this doesn't matter. But to some knowing what makes your hackintosh tick is part of the journey

## Wrapping up

Once you're done making your SSDT, either head to the next page to finish the rest of the SSDTs or head here if you're ready to wrap up:
